# LFP-analysis-In-Electrophysiological-Recording
This project focuses on the analysis of Local Field Potentials (LFPs) from electrophysiological recordings of macaque monkeys. The recordings were obtained using single-cell electrodes in two key brain regions: the ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex (vlPFC) and the Substantia Nigra pars reticulata (SNr).
